    <hr>
    <p>Full Name = Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</p>
    <p>DOB = 2 October 1869</p>
    <i>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as the "Father of the Nation" in India, was a visionary leader who played a crucial
        <br>
        role in India’s struggle for independence from British rule. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, he
        <br>
        became a global icon for his philosophy of nonviolence (Ahimsa) and truth (Satya). Through his unique method of
        <br>
        Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance), he led numerous movements against colonial rule, inspiring millions to fight
        <br>
        for freedom peacefully.</i>

    <strong>
        Gandhi’s influence extended beyond India, shaping civil rights movements across the world, including those led <br>
        by Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. His principles of simplicity, self-discipline, and social justice <br>
        continue to inspire generations. His birthday, October 2nd, is observed as the International Day of <br>
        Non-Violence, highlighting his lasting impact on the world.
